📊 Superstore Sales Analysis
🔎 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Superstore dataset to uncover insights into sales, profit, customer segments, and regional performance.
It demonstrates skills in:

SQL (data cleaning, aggregation, analysis)
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) (EDA, visualization, additional insights)
GitHub portfolio building

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
1. SQL Server 2022 (T-SQL)
2. Python 3.x (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
3. GitHub for portfolio presentation

✅ SQL Analysis Highlights
The SQL analysis answers key business questions such as:
Monthly Sales Trends – Are sales growing over time?
Top 10 Profitable Products – Which products contribute most to profit?
Regional Sales Breakdown – Which regions drive the highest sales?
Customer Segmentation – How do sales vary by customer segment?
Impact of Discounts – Do discounts actually improve profit?
Top 10 Customers by Sales – Who are the most valuable customers?
Category Performance – Which categories perform best in terms of sales and profit?

✅ Python Analysis Highlights
The Python notebook expands the SQL insights with visualizations and deeper EDA:
Line charts for monthly sales trends
Bar charts for top products, customers, and categories
Scatterplot showing relationship between discounts and profit
Correlation heatmap for numeric variables (Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity)

🧑‍💼 Key Takeaways
📌 Consistent monthly growth patterns in sales
📌 High discounts often reduce profitability
📌 Top customers and products disproportionately drive revenue
📌 Technology category generates the highest profit margins
